### New App Idea
A journal application that allows users to build a customizable digital journal. Users can design their journal from scratch or use a pre-defined template. Users would be able to modify their journal with features like a dynamically changing quote or a mood tracker. This way they can design a journal that best fits what they're looking for since a lot of physical journals either only contain line paper or features that users only find half useful.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Just getting familiar with where the tools are located in XCode.
